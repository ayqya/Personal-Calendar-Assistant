      "\n",
      "- Spider plants are non-toxic and have mild effects if ingested. They also help clean indoor air.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Pothos is another good option. It's non-toxic but can cause mild stomach upset if eaten. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Ponytail palms are pet safe and easy to care for. The leaves are non-toxic.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Philodendrons are mildly toxic if eaten but tend to be left alone by cats. Place them out of reach to be safe.\n",
